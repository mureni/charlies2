    "The [nArtifact] says we're [adjPolite]. The pager says we're [adjBleak]. The pager is always the honest one.",
    "We turned [nAbstraction] into religion and [nMetric] into scripture, and now nobody remembers the product.",
    "Nothing in [nSystem] is owned; it's merely inherited, [advTone], by whoever is [verbSuffer]ing on-call.",
