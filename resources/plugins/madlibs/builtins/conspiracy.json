    "According to [nInstitution], it was [nClaim]. According to the [nEvidence], it was [adjSoft] and worth [verbNotice]ing.",
    "It's wild how fast [nArtifact] appears after [nEvent], like it was already queued in [nPipeline].",
    "[fixedHook] how everyone lands on the same phrasing. That's not consensus; that's [nMechanism].",
    "[advHedge], it's nothing, but the [nEvidence] reads like a template somebody reused.",
    "You can call it [nClaim], but you don't get that level of [adjHard] response without [nMechanism].",
    "[nThey] don't have to control everything; they just have to control the defaults around [nAbstract].",
    "People imagine conspiracies as villains in a room. It's usually [nPipeline] plus [nMechanism] plus nobody wanting blame.",
    "[fixedPlausible], but [fixedHook] how [nInstitution] [verbDeny] questions about the [nEvidence] faster than they explain the event.",
    "If [nEvent] was really [nClaim], why does it require [meetingName] and three separate [nArtifact]s?",
    "The [nEvidence] isn't proof of a cabal; it's proof of a workflow. Workflows beat intentions every time.",
    "You ever notice how [nAbstract] gets redefined right after [nEvent]? That's [nMechanism] in plain sight.",
    "[fixedHook] the procurement trail. When the same vendors show up after every [nEvent], it stops feeling random.",
    "It's always [nClaim] until you [verbNotice] the calendar overlap and the identical talking points.",
    "The impressive trick isn't hiding [nEvent]. It's making people argue about [nVibe] instead of the [nEvidence].",
    "[fixedPlausible], but [nInstitution] runs [nRitual]s the way old religions ran seasons.",
    "Everyone argues about what happened. I'm watching what got approved before it happened.",
    "The official story is less about truth and more about maintaining [nAbstract] with minimal disruption.",
    "[fixedHook] how [nEvent] becomes a reason to expand [nPipeline]. That's the pattern I can't unsee.",
    "When the [nEvidence] points one way and the [nArtifact] points another, you're watching [nMechanism] do damage control.",
    "Maybe it's [nClaim]. Or maybe the system is doing what systems do: protecting [nAbstract] through [nMechanism].",
    "People ask who did this. Better question: what incentives make this the stable outcome?",
    "[fixedPlausible], but [fixedHook] how [nInstitution] reacts faster than they investigate.",
    "The weird part isn't that [nThey] exist. The weird part is how predictable the sequence has become.",
    "Watch the language shift: impossible, unlikely, always known, resolved.",
    "You don't need forbidden knowledge. You need version history, a calendar, and ten minutes of attention.",
    "The [nEvidence] doesn't scream mastermind; it whispers process, risk, containment.",
    "Every time [nEvent] happens, [nAbstract] gets fenced off a little more, and everyone calls it maturity.",
    "[fixedHook] the edits. Quiet changes, loud certainty. That's how the story trains itself.",
    "[advHedge], it's not malicious. It's just [nMechanism] doing what it was built to do.",
    "[fixedPlausible], but if you can predict the next [nArtifact] after [nEvent], you're not guessing anymore.",
    "People laugh at conspiracies and then accept [nMechanism] as how things work.",
    "The scariest version isn't a villain. It's a machine that rewards the same lie forever.",
    "[fixedHook] how questioning the [nEvidence] becomes harm, while rewriting [nAbstract] becomes safety.",
    "You don't need a hidden hand to see the visible choreography of [nRitual].",
    "The pattern is simple: [nEvent] triggers [nRitual], which justifies [nPipeline], which reshapes [nAbstract].",
    "[fixedPlausible], but the cleanest scams are the ones called policy and filed under best practices.",
    "The moment I saw [ticketId] attached to [nEvent], it stopped feeling spontaneous.",
    "If this was random, it wouldn't already have [docVersion] approved by the [committeeName].",
    "[nEvent] hit the news after [meetingName], not before. That's a tell.",
    "You don't spin up [meetingName] for a one-off; you do it when [policyClause] is about to move.",
    "Nothing says coincidence like [ticketId] created before the public announcement.",
    "People argue online while the real decisions get logged under [policyClause] and scheduled for [calendarSlot].",
    "[fixedHook] how [committeeName] convened before anyone admitted [nEvent] existed.",
    "It's informal until it gets a [ticketId], then it's suddenly process.",
    "Once something has [docVersion], it has history. History doesn't come from accidents.",
    "[advHedge], but when an issue gets tagged [ticketId], it's already inside the machine.",
    "Watch the wording change after [meetingName]; that's when [nAbstract] gets redefined.",
    "The cleanest tell is when [nEvent] immediately spawns [ticketId] and a standing meeting.",
